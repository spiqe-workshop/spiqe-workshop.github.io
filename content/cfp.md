Security protocols are essential for safeguarding the digital communications and interactions that form the backbone of modern society. These protocols are increasingly under pressure from both classical vulnerabilities, such as implementation flaws, as well as emerging threats, such as posed by quantum computing. The migration to post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms is a complex process that will affect the design, implementation, and analysis of security protocols in the coming years.

The workshop on Secure Protocol Implementations in the Quantum Era (SPIQE) seeks contributed papers and talks that address the challenges of implementing traditional security protocols and how these can be used to build secure quantum-resistant solutions. As with classical protocols, many security vulnerabilities stem from implementation errors, exacerbated by the increasing complexity of protocol specifications. The introduction of post-quantum algorithms adds further complexity, raising new questions on how to implement and analyze these protocols securely and efficiently.

We invite submissions from both academia and industry that present cutting-edge research on security protocol implementations, particularly those that address the unique challenges of post-quantum migration. How can we ensure that the transition to PQC is both smooth and secure? How can we systematically analyze implementations, statically and dynamically, to mitigate the introduction of flaws during this transition? How can we ensure that specifications are precise, easily understandable, and capable of being correctly implemented, especially when considering the additional complexity introduced by PQC?

### Important Dates

Submission deadline: Mar 12th, 2026 (AoE)

Acceptance notification: April 10th, 2026 (AoE)

### Submission Guidelines

Submitted **papers** must be written in English and non-anonymous, including the list of authors. The submission must be in the form of an extended abstract up to three pages (letter or DIN A4), and include a link to the full version of the paper published at an Open Access conference or journal paper, or an established archival site such as arXiv or eprint.iacr.org.

The extended abstract (at most 3 pages, not including references) should contain a non-technical, clear and insightful description of the main ideas, results, their impact, and relationship with concurrent and prior work. Extended abstracts should not be a compressed version of a full paper, but instead should facilitate an intuitive understanding of the research results that they represent and help the Program Committee assess their importance. The submission should highlight new conceptual contributions and make the ideas involved as broadly accessible as possible.

Submissions must be done electronically in PDF format. Every accepted paper must have at least one author registered for the workshop and present the talk in person.

Proposals for **talks** should conform to the submission format (up to three pages), as described above. They are not required to link to full-length research papers. They should present the key themes of the talk for the reviewers to assess its potential impact and quality. Talks will be judged on this basis, competitively with paper submissions, to select high-quality and/or high-impact talks and papers. Talk proposals should be clearly marked as such by having their title begin with "Talk Proposal:".

We also include the AI Guidelines, Proactive Prevention of Harm, and Open Science Expectations of the Euro S&P conference in this call for contributions. For your convenience, they are reproduced below.

### AI Guidelines

The use of AI-generated content (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. At the time of submission, the acknowledgments do not count towards the page limit. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.

The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is not required, but recommended.

### Proactive Prevention of Harm

We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.

### Open Science Expectations

Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that precludes publishing the data itself. All submissions are encouraged to include a clear statement on Data Availability that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. If data reproducibility is required for significant contributions of the work and the authors do not explain reproducibility and/or share the artifacts, papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.
